# Versioning and support

## Versioning

We will follow Semver https://semver.org/ 

    major.minor.patch

We increase `major` version number when there is breaking change
We increase `minor` version number when there is new feature added
We increase `patcher` version number when there is bugs update, which can contain multiple bug fixes. 

## Support
We will support latest `major` version, any earlier `major` version depends on number of installation for the month.

For each `major` version we will only support the latest `minor` version. 

Any bug reported right before a next minor version is release will be included into patch of next minor version
